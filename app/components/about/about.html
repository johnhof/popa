          <span>Hello!</span>
          I am a full stack web developer hailing from the University of Pittsburgh. I started studying computer science because I had to study something. I fell in love and never looked back. I've touched everything from Assembly to Stylus. Programming has turned from a job, into my favorite hobby.
