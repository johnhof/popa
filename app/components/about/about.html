          I am a full stack web developer hailing from the University of Pittsburgh. I started studying computer science because I had to study something. and I fell in love and never looked back. I've touched everything from Assembly to Stylus and found that the web is the most exciting place to be. Programming has turned from a job, into my favorite hobby.
